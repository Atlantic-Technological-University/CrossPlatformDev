# Week three: Navigation in .NET MAUI

## Repository content  

The code demonstrates different styles of naviagation within a .NET MAUI application using both flyout menu system, tabss and simple pages using built in .NET navigation classes and the AppShell.  

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
