# Week twelve: CI/CD with GitHub Actions and .NET MAUI  

In week twelve of the module we explore how we can create a continuous integration and delivery pipeline with GitHub actions. In particular we examine how we can:

* Utilise trunk based braching.  
* Automatically build and test our code using a GitHub actions workflow.  
* Scan and lint our codebase.
* Use branch protections and code reviews.
* Create release candidates.

## Repository content

The demo code contains a boilerplate .NET MAUI application and accompanying xUnit test project. Note the changes in the xUnit project file.  

A full set of instructional videos demonstrating how to implement the CI/CD pipeline using the starter project is available in the module area in blackboard.  

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
