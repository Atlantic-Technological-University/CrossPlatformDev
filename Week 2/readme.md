# Week two: Implementing user interfaces in .NET MAUI  

In week two of the module we explore how we can create user interfaces (UIs) using XAML in Microsoft .NET MAUI. We explore different layout definitions such as stacks, grids, absolute and flexible layout. The use of resource dictionaries and styles to define common layouts for UI controls is also explored.  

## Repository content  

The code demonstrates how to layout UI elements using a variety of layout structures in addition to defining common UI controls such as text, input fields and buttons.  

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
