# Week nine: Persistent storage with .NET MAUI   
In week nine of the module we explore different data storage solutions for .NET MAUI applications. In particular we examine how we can use:

* Use an appsettings.json file to specify settings and feature flags for an application. 
* Save and retrieve application settings using the IConfiguration interface.  
* Save and retrieve user preferences.
* Read and write data to text and JSON files.
* Create, update, read and delete data from an SQLite relational database on a local device.


## Repository content
The demo code creates a skeleton implementation of a simple .NET MAUI application that displays a collection of UFO encounters. 

A full set of instructional videos demonstrating how to implement this application from a .NET MAUI starter project is available in the module area in blackboard. 

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
