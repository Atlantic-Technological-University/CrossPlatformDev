# Week eight: Test driven development with xUnit and .NET MAUI  

In week eight of the module we explore test driven development and how we can use a unit testing framework such as xUnit to test our .NET MAUI ApplicationS.

## Repository content  

The demo code creates a skeleton implementation of a simple .NET MAUI application that displays mimics a mobile banking application. A ViewModel class uses a data service that obtains a list of transactions for a given bank account. A partial view class implements data pickers which can be used to specify the dates between which the user may want to view transactions on thier account.  

A full set of instructional videos demonstrating how to implement this application from a .NET MAUI starter project is available in the module area in blackboard.  

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
