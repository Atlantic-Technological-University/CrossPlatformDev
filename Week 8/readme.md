# Week eight: Platform features with .NET MAUI   
In week seven of the module we explore a number of features including navigating to a details page from a CollectionView item, location services, customising a UI with OnPlatform and OnIdiom XAML extensions and, executing platform specific code with conditional compilation.

## Repository content
The demo code creates a skeleton implementation of a simple .NET MAUI application that displays a collection of UFO encounters. 

A full set of instructional videos demonstrating how to implement this application from a .NET MAUI starter project is available in the module area in blackboard. 

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
