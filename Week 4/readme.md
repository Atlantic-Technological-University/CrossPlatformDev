# Week four: Passing data in .NET MAUI   
In week four of the module we explore how to pass data between .NET MAUI pages using URI navigation calls, QueryParameters and IQueryAttributable.

## Repository content
The starter code creates a simple .NET MAUI application that renders basic information about different types of trees (evergreen and deciduous). Basic tree information is loaded from a JSON file and stored in a simple list. The instructional videos demonstrate how to pass data between .NET MAUI pages using URI navigation, QueryParameters and a Dictionary. 

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
